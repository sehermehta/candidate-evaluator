# Deploying Candidate Evaluator To Streamlit Cloud

This app is a Streamlit app. It can run on Railway or Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Railway

1. Deploy this repository using the included Dockerfile.
2. Add a persistent volume mounted at `/data`.
3. Set `CANDIDATE_DATA_DIR=/data` and an `APP_PASSWORD` in service variables.
4. Generate a public domain after the service is healthy.

The app requires a password on Railway and stops before loading candidate data
when the password is not configured. Each browser session must sign in. This is
a single-team app: signed-in users share runs and results.
The volume stores new runs and exports across deployments. Existing runs on your
Mac are not uploaded with the application. Download exports as a separate backup.

## Before You Deploy

- Do not upload `.venv/`, `work/`, `outputs/`, or local result files to GitHub.
- Do not hardcode an OpenAI API key. The app asks for the key in the UI.
- Uploaded candidate JSON files and rubrics should be uploaded through the deployed app UI.

## GitHub Files Needed

Upload these files and folders:

- `app.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `.streamlit/config.toml`
- `candidate_evaluator/`
- `README.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`

Do not upload:

- `.venv/`
- `work/`
- `outputs/`
- `__pycache__/`
- `.pytest_cache/`
